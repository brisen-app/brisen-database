          summarize: |
            Provide your final response in markdown with the following content:

            - If necessary, suggest some improvements to the changes in the form
            of a bullet list. Max two bullets.

            - Roast the changes in a creative way. Format it as a quote using the ">"
            symbol and feel free to use emojis where relevant. Max two sentences.

            Avoid additional commentary as this will be added as a comment on the 
            GitHub pull request.

            List all changes as a bullet list. Focus on database schema changes
            and changes to functions, ignore any changes to the seed.sql file.
            Create a heading for the database schema changes and a heading for
            each function change. Use markdown formatting.
